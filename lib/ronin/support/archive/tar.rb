      #
      # Create a tar reader stream around an existing IO object:
      #
      #     Tar.new(io) do |tar|
      #       file = tar['file.txt']
      #       puts "#{file.full_name} (#{file.header.umode})"
      #       puts file.read
      #     end
      #
      # Opening a tar writer stream around an existing IO object:
      #
      #     Tar.new(io, mode: 'w') do |tar|
      #       # add a file
      #       tar.add_file('file1.txt', "...")
      #
      #       # add a file and open an output stream
      #       tar.add_file('file2.txt') do |io|
      #         io.write("...")
      #       end
      #
